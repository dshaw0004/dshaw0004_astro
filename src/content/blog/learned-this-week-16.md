description: "Everyday we learn something new but sometimes we forgot that because did not note that down. Specially I do, so I started to write down a small brief about everything I learned. And decided to share that with everyone on weekly basis so that others might learn something new."

1. In Mathematics, factorial of 0 is 1. Here is how -

```
By defination, X! = X * (X-1)!
            Or X!/X = (X-1)!
for X = 1
    1!/1 = (1-1)!
    1/1 = 0!
Or  1 = 0!
```

2. If we make a sequence of all prime numbers then all the numbers at prime index(e.g., 3, 5, 7 etc) are called **Super Prime** number.

Thatâ€™s it for this week. Meeting you next week.
