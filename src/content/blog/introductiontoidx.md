**Project IDX** is an experimental IDE aimed to bring entire full-stack, multiplatform app development workflow to the cloud. The **Project IDX** is built by **Google**. Currently this IDE is not openly available for all. For now only few of developers are have access to it because they have joined the wait list earlier. Luckily I am one of them. It has been quite a while I got the access to it but I have tried it till last week.

Take a look in its homepage.

Currently we can only have _**2 project**_ at a time.

Here you can import your project from github or you can create a new project with template provided by them.

## Project Templates

As it now we have 5 sub categories in templates. Those are -

- **Web App**
- **Backend**
- **Mobile**
- **AI & ML**
- **MISC**

we will discuss about these templates later. Let's create a project quickly to get started. For this I am going to select **Misc** template which is basically a blank project.

## Create a project

Creating a new project in **Project IDX** is very easy. Just few click and done your project is ready to jump start in coding.

- **Step 1:** Firstly select your template then do a simple click on it. You will greeted with this dialog asking for project name.

- **Step 2:** Enter the project name then click on create button and done. Wait for few minutes untill it build and setup the workspace.

- **Step 3:** Once the workspace is set up start coding.

The interface of **Project IDX** is very similar to VS Code. So if you are familiar with VS Code you won't have any problem migrating to it.

For this blank project we have a blank workspace which we have to configure. In the Readme file of the workspace we a link to a idx guide website where they explain how to configure a blank workspace.

If you don't want the headache of configuring the workspace, IDX contains a lot of prebuild workspace template. We will discuss about that later.

For now let's wrap up. Stay in touch to get all updates in IDX.
