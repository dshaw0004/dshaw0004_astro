description: "Everyday we learn something new but sometimes we forgot that because did not note that down. Specially I do, so I started to write down a small brief about everything I learned. And decided to share that with everyone on weekly basis so that others might learn something new."

1. While clicking a link in browser if we hold **`SHIFT`** it will open the link in a new window.

2. While clicking a link in browser if we hold **`CTRL`** it will open the link in a new tab.

3. In javascript if we get the current timestamp it will give the timestamp in milliseconds.
Whereas in python the timestamp is in seconds and floating point number.
So if you have any application which uses js timestamp in python or vice versa then divide that timestamp by 1000 for *js->py* and multiply by 1000 for *py->js* respectively.

4. To close a browser tab using javascript use this snippet **`window.close('', 'parent', '');`**. 
This is really helpful because all the other listed ways to close tab using `window.close` on **stackoverflow** did not work while I tested them
but it works.
Ironically I found this code snippet while I was inspecting a **Goverment Website**.

Thatâ€™s it for this week. Meeting you next week.
And if you asking why there is no week 13 because I am getting lazy to notedown stuffs.
