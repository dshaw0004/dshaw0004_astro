Before beginning with it I should clearify first why am I writing this.
Every day we learn something, specially me because I recently started using Linux for fulltime. So I am learning something every day about it. But I find out that I forget most of it because I do not write it down.
So I start writing it down. Also I thought that I should share this with everyone. And this is the third week.
There might be some information which is new to you. So let's get started.


1. In Linux File System, **`/proc`** contains bunch of files like- **`cpuinfo`**, **`meminfo`**.
These files contains information about those components. Example `cpuinfo` contains information about cpu utilization, speed etc.

2. Also **`/proc`** contains bunch of folders of random numbers, those folders contains data of each process.
And each folder name represent the process id.

3. In Linux, to cron job a task we can use **crontab**.
It is a configuration file used by **cron daemon**. 
We can add new cronjob by editing the file using **`sudo crontab -e`**.

4. In Linux, to print all the drive partitions **`lsblk`** command can be used

5. Google have introduced a new **JPEG** coding library called **JPEGLI**. 
It is designed to be faster, more efficient, and more visually pleasing than traditional JPEG. 
But I don't know what is this actually. 

Thatâ€™s it for this week. Meeting you next week.
