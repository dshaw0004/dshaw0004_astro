Before beginning with it I should clearify first why am I writing this.
Every day we learn something, specially me because I recently started using Linux for fulltime. So I am learning something every day about it. But I find out that I forget most of it because I do not write it down.
So I start writing it down. Also I thought that I should share this with everyone. And this is the third week.
There might be some information which is new to you. So let's get started.


1. In Vim, **`~`** will toggle the case of the letter under the cursor. i.e., lower case to upper case or vice versa.
To apply this to an entire word we can use **`g~w`**.

2. In Vim, to toggle case of entire sentence inside a html tag use **`g~it`**.

3. Similar to previous keybinding, to select the entire content inside a html tag use **`vit`**.

4. In Vim, to fix the indentation of a small block of code firstly select that block of code in *visual* mode then press **`=`**.

5. In Vim, to fix the indentation of entire file use **`gg=G`**.

6. In Linux (specially Ubuntu Gnome), to take a screenshot just press the **`prt sc` (Print Screen)** key on your keyboard, it will open screenshot window.

7. In Linux (specially Ubuntu Gnome), to start screen recording press **`ctrl + alt + shift + R`** to open recording window.

Thatâ€™s it for this week. Meeting you next week.
