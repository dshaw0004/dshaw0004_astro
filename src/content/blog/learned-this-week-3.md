Before beginning with it I should clearify first why am I writing this.
Every day we learn something, specially me because I recently started using Linux for fulltime. So I am learning something every day about it. But I find out that I forget most of it because I do not write it down.
So I start writing it down. Also I thought that I should share this with everyone. And this is the third week.
There might be some information which is new to you. So let's get started.

> **Small Disclaimer**:- it is not a typical blog post where we deeply discuss about something. Here I will provide only a small brief about lots of thing.



1. In Python, to compare 2 list we have to first sort it. Even if 2 list have same characters and same length they are not same if index of each characters does not match.

```Python

l1 = [ 1, 3, 2, 4 ]
l2 = [ 2, 4, 1, 3 ]

print(l1 == l2) # False
print(l1.sort() == l2.sort()) # True

```

2. In Photo Editing, applying guassian blur to a noised image can decrease the noisyness but it will decrease the image quality.

3. **NVM**, **Node Version Manager** is a really great tool that can manage multiple versions of node in the same machine.

4. [freelinuxpcgames.com](https://freelinuxpcgames.com) is a great website from where we can get some good games for linux

5. In Linux, there is a software namely **Wine** or **WineHQ** which can run windows application on linux.
Also it is very easy to use, just type `wine path/to/file.exe` in the terminal.


Thatâ€™s it for this week. Meeting you next week.
