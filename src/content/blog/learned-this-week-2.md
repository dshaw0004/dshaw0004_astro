Before beginning with it I should clearify first why am I writing this.
Every day we learn something, specially me because I recently started using Linux for fulltime. So I am learning something every day about it. But I find out that I forget most of it because I do not write it down.
So I start writing it down. Also I thought that I should share this with everyone. And this is the second week. 
There might be some information which is new to you. So let's get started.

> **Small Disclaimer**:- it is not a typical blog post where we deeply discuss about something. Here I will provide only a small brief about lots of thing.



1. In Linux, ***`WC`*** command can be used to get lots of information about a text file. Like- word count, lines count, maximum line length etc. `wc filename.txt` will display number of lines, words in that file and the size of the file.


2. In Linux, the ***`DU`*** command in Linux is used to estimate file and directory space usage. 
Also when using on a directory it will list out all the files in that directory. 
You can run it with the following syntax:
```
du filename or path/to/directory
```


3. In Linux, To print all the non empty lines of a text file we can use ***`awk`*** command.
`awk 'NF' filename`, this command prints only the lines that have non-empty lines.


4. In Mathematics, there is a formula called william's formula which can be used to determine whether or not a number is prime number. 
The formula for number **j** is `[(j-1)!+1/j]`.

5. In Linux, we can use ***`printenv`*** to list down all the environment variables name and their value.

Thatâ€™s it for this week. Meeting you next week.
