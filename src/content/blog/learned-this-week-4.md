Before beginning with it I should clearify first why am I writing this.
Every day we learn something, specially me because I recently started using Linux for fulltime. So I am learning something every day about it. But I find out that I forget most of it because I do not write it down.
So I start writing it down. Also I thought that I should share this with everyone. And this is the third week.
There might be some information which is new to you. So let's get started.

> **Small Disclaimer**:- it is not a typical blog post where we deeply discuss about something. Here I will provide only a small brief about lots of thing.



1. In Python, to remove suffix from a string use **`.removesuffix()`** method and pass the suffix which you want to remove as a argument to **`.removesuffix()`** method.

2. In Python, to convert an normal list into a numpy array use `numpy.array(my_list)`. I knew this but my memory is more volatile than a RAM.

3. In Linux, ***`!!`*** stores the last executed command. 
This can also be used to add suffix or prefix to the last command.
example:- if you entered **`apt update`** command in the terminal and forgot to add sudo privillage, you can enter ***`sudo !!`***. It will result in `sudo apt update`.
Again this can be used to add commands at the end of previous command by doing this ***`!! new_command`***.

4. In Vim, ***`ctrl-r`*** is the keymap for **redo**. 
I have been using vim for a long time but I just learn this today.

5. In Vim, **`>>`** will indent the current line and **`<<`** will unindent the current line.

6. In Linux, instead of using ***`clear`*** command to clear the terminal we can use ***`ctrl+l`*** to clear the terminal.

7. In Linux Terminal, if we enter the command ***`!$`*** it will echo and execute the last executed command.

8. Certainly there is an atom which is lighter than **Hydrogen** named **Muonium**.
It can be made inside **Particle Accelerator**. And it has only 2 micro seconds of life.


Thatâ€™s it for this week. Meeting you next week.
